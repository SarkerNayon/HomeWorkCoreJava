/*03) Create a package "hw9Q3Polymorphism" inside your HW project and execute the remaining. Read the question very carefully. 
 * Create a class Sister. Can you create several methods with the same name inside it? Give the method name ageOfSisters. 
 * As a variable, use int age1, int age2, int age3, String age4, int age5, int age6 etc in different combination. 
 * Use void type, parameterized type, return type, static type, final type method by different combinations of the above variable.
 *  Tell me what is the Method overloading. initialize all the methods in TestFamily class. Create another class Niece and inherit Sister. 
 *  Override all the possible methods by changing logic. If some methods are not possible to override, please explain why by comments. 
 *  Initialize all the methods in TestFamily class.
 *
